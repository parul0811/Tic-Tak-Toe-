# Tic-Tak-Toe
Tic Tac Toe is a simple game that can be built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game board is typically a 3x3 grid of squares, with each square representing a space where players can place their mark. The game can be played between two players, who take turns placing their mark on the board.

To build the game using HTML and CSS, the game board can be created using a table element. Each table cell represents a square on the board, and can be styled using CSS to create the visual appearance of the game board.

The JavaScript code is used to handle the game logic, including keeping track of the player's moves and determining the winner of the game. This can be done using event listeners to detect when a player has clicked on a square on the board and updating the game state accordingly.

Overall, Tic Tac Toe is a great project for beginners to practice their HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills, while also learning about game development and user interface design.
